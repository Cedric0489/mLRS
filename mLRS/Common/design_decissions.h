some experimental results

25 ms
rx = 16,1 ms  tx = 7.80 ms
20 ms
rx = 11.1 ms, tx = 7.80 ms
estimated time over air is 7.8128 ms

a 2nd timing check for pll:

treceive_done - treceive    = ca 11.6 ms
ttransmit - treceive        = ca 11.7 ms
ttransmit_done - treceive   = ca 19.9 ms
tplltick - treceive         = ca 11.6 ms
tdopostreceive - treceive   = ca 12.6 ms with 100 shift
tpllupdate - treceive       = ca 16.6 ms with 500 shift


experimental finding
on receiver:
amptx   amprx     rssi on transmitter   rx_rssi on transmitter
high    low       -22                   -18
high    high      -22                   -54     => bad reception of receiver
low     low       -83                   -19     => bad transmission of receiver
low     high      -83                   -54     => both

Amps

SE2431L (siyi FM30):
3.6V, Pin = 3 dBm => Pout = 24.0 dBm (251mW)
3.3V, Pin = 0 dBm => Pout = 22.5 dBm (178mW)
signal gain typical 22 dBm (19-25 dBm)
Pin max = 6 dBm

=> do not feed it with more that 6 dBm !!
0 dBm should be a good choice

-10 dBm = 0.1 mW in -> ca 12 dBm / 16 mW out
0 dBm = 1 mW in -> ca 22 dBm / 158 mW out


SX1280 max output power = 12.5 dBm = 17.783 W
SiGe SE2431L
max output power = 24 dBm , 22.5 dBm at 3.3V = 177.8 mW
gain is 22 dBm
max input power is 6 dBm
=> do not use more than 6 dBm
   1 dBm should be way OK

-------------------------------------------------------
one needs to decide between small frames at higher rate or fat frames at lower rate
with some retransmission capability slim frames would have an advantage
maybe they would do generally
but to start with, let's go with fat frames
it should not be very difficult to go to slim frames later

a benefit of slim frames would be faster reconnection after connection loss
this could be potentially extremely crucial !!!
50 Hz = 20 ms & 64 frequencies => up to 1.3 secs to connect !!
200 Hz = 5 ms & 64 frequencies => up to 0.32 secs to connect
250 Hz = 4 ms & 64 frequencies => up to 0.26 secs to connect
we could reduce the number of frequencies for the connection state, e.g. just 16
50 Hz = 20 ms & 16 frequencies => up to 0.32 secs to connect

slim frames my also allow us to detected more quickly if the connection is lost
=> reconnection in case of connection loss might be much faster
DO not confuse with micro failsafes

experimentally I find:
on rx many packets are received, a good fraction of them pass crc1 test,
ergo, it seems that in long packets it is more likely that the early bytes are ok than the latter
similarly, on tx many quite more packets are received than do pass valid test
=> I think smaller packets have the benefit that more of those received will be valid

is it possible to improve that by using the frequency error correction ???


what LORA settings could be useful?

it appears that BW 800kHz provides the best tradeoff between high data rate and high receive sensitivity
so let's go with 800kHz

the highest rate setting would then be

5 / 800   = -105 dBm = 56.39 kbps, 105 bytes = 9.97 ms => 52.5kbps   this could be siyi FM30, doesn't it ??


so, the frame should have the channels, the payload, and additional info and crcs

channels idea 1:
12 ch @ 11 bits = 132 bits
 6 ch @  7 bits =  42 bits
 2 ch @  1 bits =   2 bits
                 -----------
                  176 bits = 22 bytes

channels idea 2:
 4 ch @ 11 bits =  44 bits
10 ch @  8 bits =  80 bits
 4 ch @  1 bits =   4 bits
                 -----------
                  128 bits = 16 bytes

channels idea 3:
 6 ch @ 11 bits =  66 bits
 8 ch @  7 bits =  56 bits
 2 ch @  2 bits =   4 bits
 2 ch @  1 bits =   2 bits
                 -----------
                  128 bits = 16 bytes


auxiliary:
- sequence no (few bits are sufficient to check for lost packets), e.g. 4 = 16 frames = 0.8 sec
- receive confirmation flag (to resend if missed), 1 bit
- packet type, e.g. 4 bits
- rssi (doesn't have to be 8 bit, 7 or 6 would be also ok)
- LQ (doesn't have to be 8 bit, 7 or 6 would be also ok)
- sync word
- payload len (doesn't have to be 8 bit, 7 bit should be OK)

example 1:

1:    sync byte 1
2:    sync byte 2
3:    status (seq. no, ack flag, packet type)
4:    rssi
5:    LQ
6:    payload len
7:-
|     6 bytes of RC data  (4 ch @ 11 bits & 4 ch @ bit)
12:-
13:   crc1
14:-
|     10 bytes of remaining RC data (10 ch @ 8 bits)
23:-
24:   crc2
25:-
|     64 bytes of payload
88:-
89:   crc3
90:   crc4

=> 90 bytes/frame = 7.81 ms air time
=> 3200 B/s @ 50 Hz

1:    sync byte 1
2:    sync byte 2
3:    status (seq. no, ack flag, packet type)
4:    rssi
5:    LQ
6:    payload len
7:-
|     82 bytes of payload
88:-
89:   crc3
90:   crc4

=> 4100 B/s @ 50 Hz

longer downlink frame?
e.g.

1:    sync byte 1
2:    sync byte 2
3:    status (seq. no, ack flag, packet type)
4:    rssi
5:    LQ
6:    payload len
7:-
|     100 bytes of payload
106:-
107:   crc3
108:   crc4

=> 108 bytes/frame = 9.23 ms air time
=> 5000 B/s @ 50 Hz


=< let's start with 90 bytes/frame
