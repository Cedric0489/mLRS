# mLRS Documentation: SeeedStudio Wio-E5 Boards #

([back to main page](../README.md))

The SeeedStudio (Wio-E5 module)[https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-E5_STM32WLE5JC_Module] is a highly attractive module for building mLRS equipment. SeeedStudio provides a number of boards which are based on this module, and which are thus hence interesting hardware for mLRS. However, these boards also provide some inconveniences since their pins are not ready made for the purposes of mLRS. So, sonme tweaking and (easy) soldering is required.
